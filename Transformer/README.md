# Transformer Implementation

This repository contains an end-to-end implementation of the Transformer model, as introduced by Vaswani et al. in their groundbreaking paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762).

## Introduction

The Transformer model has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and has become the foundation for many state-of-the-art models such as BERT, GPT, and T5. This repository provides an end-to-end implementation of the original Transformer model, including detailed explanations and code.

## Architecture Overview

The Transformer architecture is composed of an encoder and a decoder, each with multiple layers. The key components include:
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
- **Position-Wise Feed-Forward Networks**: Applied independently to each position in the sequence.
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds information about the position of each word in the sequence.
- **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Improve training and convergence.
